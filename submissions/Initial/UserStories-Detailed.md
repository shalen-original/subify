**Create new subtitles**
Tina  as just finished creating a new amazing video about cats, which, by the way, she loves. Immediatly after finishing the rendering, she realizes that only German people will be able to understand the video, because that is the language used by the actors. However, she would like to show her video to the entire world: in order to do that, she can access our web app, open the new video she created and start adding subtitles for every language she wants. After adding the subtitle for a new language, she can export those as a file and ship them with her video.

John only knows English, but he has just found an amazing copyright-free Russian documentary about the wild environment of Siberia that he would like to watch. He also managed to find English subtitles for that video, but there is a problem: the comment are not syncrhonised with the video! Every subtitle appears five seconds after than it should. John can easily load the subtitle file to our webapp and with just a few clicks he can shift all the subtitles five seconds in advance.

**Correct mistake in subtitles**
Anna's favourite movie is *A Farewell to Arms*, a true masterpiece according to her. Her only problem is that she can not find subtitles in her native language that are enjoyable; all files she can find are full of typos and misspellings. She would really like to watch the movie in the original language, since last time she watched a translation, and she felt that the dubbing was not that great. With our webapp Anna does not need anything else than her tablet and an internet connection to fix the subtitles by herself, export them and enjoy her movie.

**Manually fix some subtitle timing**
Frank is doing a short documentary about his hometown for a school project. His group decided to make the film available online and to provide captions such that also viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing can enjoy their work. Kevin was in charge of creating the subtitles, but he made a mess with the timing, a lot of captions are off by several seconds. Tim can easily load our web app, upload the subtitle file and the video, check the timings with the generated wave form, and correct Kevin's mess without installing any additional software.
